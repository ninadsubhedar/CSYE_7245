    "An ER model is typically implemented as a database. In a simple\n",
    "relational database implementation, each row of a table represents one instance of an entity type, and each field in a table represents an attribute type. In a [relational database] a relationship between\n",

    "This is the highest level ER model in that it contains the least granular detail but establishes the overall scope of what is to be included within the model set. The conceptual ER model normally defines master reference data entities that are commonly used by the organization. Developing an enterprise-wide conceptual ER model is useful to support documenting the [data architecture] for an\n",
    " organization. A conceptual ER model may be used as the foundation for one or more _logical data models_. The purpose of the conceptual ER model is then to establish structural metadata commonality for the master data entities between the set of logical ER models. The  conceptual data model may be used to form commonality relationships between ER models as a basis for data model integration.\n",

    "A logical ER model does not require a conceptual ER model,  especially if the scope of the logical ER model includes only the development of a distinct information system. The logical ER model contains more detail than the conceptual ER model. In addition to master data entities, operational and transactional data entities are now defined. The details of each data entity are developed and the relationships between these data entities are established. The logical ER model is however developed independently of the specific database management system into which it can be implemented.\n",

    "The physical model is normally instantiated in the structural  metadata of a database management system as relational database  objects such as database tables, database indexes such as unique key indexes, and database constraints such as a foreign key constraint or a commonality constraint.

    "\n",
    "An entity is a thing that exists either physically or logically. An\n",
    "entity may be a physical object such as a house or a car (they exist\n",
    "physically), an event such as a house sale or a car service, or a\n",
    "concept such as a customer transaction or order (they exist logically—as\n",
    "a concept). Although the term entity is the one most commonly used,\n",
    "following Chen we should really distinguish between an entity and an\n",
    "entity-type. An entity-type is a category. An entity, strictly speaking,\n",
    "is an instance of a given entity-type. There are usually many instances\n",
    "of an entity-type. Because the term entity-type is somewhat cumbersome,\n",
    "most people tend to use the term entity as a synonym for this term.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Relationships, roles and cardinalities\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chen's original paper he gives an example of a relationship and its\n",
    "roles. He describes a relationship “marriage” and its two roles\n",
    "“husband” and “wife”.\n",
    "\n",
    "A person plays the role of husband in a marriage (relationship) and\n",
    "another person plays the role of wife in the (same) marriage. These\n",
    "words are nouns. That is no surprise; naming things requires a noun.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chen's terminology has also been applied to earlier ideas. The lines,\n",
    "arrows and crow's-feet of some diagrams owes more to the earlier\n",
    "[Bachman diagrams] than to Chen's relationship diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common extension to Chen's model is to “name” relationships and\n",
    "roles as verbs or phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role naming\n",
    "\n",
    "It has also become prevalent to name roles with phrases such as *is the\n",
    "owner of* and *is owned by*. Correct nouns in this case are *owner* and\n",
    "*possession*. Thus *person plays the role of owner* and *car plays the\n",
    "role of possession* rather than *person plays the role of*, *is the\n",
    "owner of*, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of nouns has direct benefit when generating physical\n",
    "implementations from semantic models. When a *person* has two\n",

    "*owner\\_person* and *driver\\_person*, which are immediately meaningful.\n",

    "Modifications to the original specification can be beneficial. Chen\n",
    "described [look-across cardinalities]. As an aside, the [Barker–Ellis]\n",
    "notation, used in Oracle Designer, uses same-side for minimum\n",

    "maximum cardinality (the crows foot).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For a binary relationship set the mapping\n",
    "cardinality must be one of the following types:\n",

    "Crow's foot diagrams represent entities as boxes, and relationships as\n",
    "lines between the boxes. Different shapes at the ends of these lines\n",
    "represent the cardinality of the relationship.\n",

    "### 1st Normal Form - The Requirements  \n",
    "\n",
    "**First normal form** (**1NF**) is a property of a relation in a\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirements to satisfy the 1st NF:  \n",
    "\n",
    "• Each table has a primary key: minimal set of attributes which can uniquely identify a record.   \n",
    "• The values in each column of a table are atomic (No multi-value attributes allowed).   \n",

    "\n",
    "1st Normal Form violated if:\n",

When you walk out the front door Scott Monument and Princes street are right in front of you, Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile is a 2 minute walk via a close right around the corner, and there are so many hidden gems nearby including Calton Hill and the newly opened Arches that made this location incredible.\\n\\nThe hotel itself was also very nice with a reasonably priced bar, very considerate staff, and small but comfortable rooms with excellent bathrooms and showers. Only two minor complaints are no telephones in room for room service (not a huge deal for us) and no AC in the room, but they have huge windows which can be fully opened. The staff were incredible though, letting us borrow umbrellas for the rain, giving us maps and directions, and also when we had lost our only UK adapter for charging our phones gave us a very fancy one for free.\\n\\nI would highly recommend this hotel to friends, and when I return to Edinburgh (which I most definitely will) I will be staying here without any hesitation.',\n",

Von diesem hier waren wir nach dem überraschend positiven Erlebnis im Motel One an der Princes Street [1] etwas enttäuscht.\\n\\nDas Hotel ist wesentlich größer und extrem unübersichtlich. Da man auf der fünften Etage noch Teile eines weiteren Gebäude, das mittels einer Glasbrücke mit dem Hauptgebäude verbunden ist, hinzugenommen hat, kann die Suche nach dem Zimmer insbesondere auf dieser Etage zu einem Gang im Labyrinth ausarten. Habe ich so noch in keinem Hotel erlebt - uns begegneten immer wieder Menschen, die sich auf der Suche nach ihren Zimmern verirrt haben.\\nUnser Zimmer war ähnlich aufgebaut wie das Zimmer im Motel One Princes Street - befand sich jedoch im Inneren des Gebäudes und hatte daher kein Fenster. Nur eine kleine Dachluke, die sich am oberen Ende eines etwa 3m langen Schachts befand, sorgte für einen minimalen Anteil Tageslicht im Zimmer. diese Luke ließ sich auch nicht öffnen, nur ein elektrisches Rollo ließ sich mittels eines Schalters öffnen bzw. schließen.\\nSonst gilt für das Zimmer eigentlich das Gleiche wie für das Zimmer im im Motel One Princes Street: Relativ klein, trotzdem extrem ansprechend und schick gestaltet und clever durchdacht. Dazu sehr ruhig.\\n\\nIm gesamten Hotel gibt es kostenloses WLAN für die Dauer des Aufenthalts für maximal 3 Geräte.\\n\\nDie Lage des Motel One Royal Mile ist großartig. Vom Airlink-Flughafenbus kann man quasi in den Hoteleingang stolpern, es sind maximal 50m. Zur Royal Mile sind es etwa 100m Luftlinie (bergauf) und man benötigt etwa 5 Minuten bis dort.\\n\\nDas Frühstück für 9,50 GBP / Person kann man nutzen - muss man aber nicht. Es ist eher übersichtlich und kontinetaler Prägung, trotzdem aber sehr gut. Für den gleichen Preis oder weniger bekommt man aber problemlos ein reichhaltiges Frühstück in einem der zahlreichen Cafes von Edinburgh.\\n\\nFür ein oder zwei Nächte kann man hier problemlos bleiben, sollte aber nicht allzuviel erwarten. Hat man die Wahl, sollte man meiner Erfahrung nach lieber auf das andere Motel One an der Princes Street ausweichen. \\n\\n\\n----\\n[1] http://www.yelp.de/biz/motel-one-edinburgh-2?hrid=7UDwl3s_DuOokkGPZXZgBw\",\n",

The bus and train stations are right across the street so it's easy access to the airport or anywhere else you may want to go. Turn uphill to old town or cross the bridge to new town. The room with a view i got was spacious and comfortable though it's a bit of a maze to find it-just follow the signs.

    "\n",
    "- COMMIT ends transaction successfully, making changes\n",
    "permanent.   \n",
    "- ROLLBACK aborts transaction, backing out any changes\n",

    "not been executed.  \n",
    "- For programmatic SQL, abnormal program end aborts\n",
    "transaction.   \n",
    "\n",
    "• New transaction starts with next transaction-initiating\n",

    "• PrivilegeList consists of one or more of above privileges\n",
    "separated by commas.  \n",
    "• ALL PRIVILEGES grants all privileges to a user.  \n",
    "• PUBLIC allows access to be granted to all present and\n",
    "future authorized users.  \n",
    "• ObjectName can be a base table, view, domain,\n",
    "character set, collation or translation.  \n",
    "• WITH GRANT OPTION allows privileges to be passed\n",
    "on.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Revoke  \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "• ALL PRIVILEGES refers to all privileges granted to a user by\n",
    "user revoking privileges.\n",
    "• GRANT OPTION FOR allows privileges passed on via WITH\n",
    "GRANT OPTION of GRANT to be revoked separately from the\n",
    "privileges themselves.   \n",
    "• REVOKE fails if it results in an abandoned object, such as a\n",
