    "\n",
    "These assignments will provide practice in real-world analysis and application of machine learning algorithms. The research can take one of the following forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "i.\tTweaking an existing machine learning algorithm.  \n",
    "ii.\tApplying an existing machine learning algorithm in a novel context.  \n",
    "iii.\tValidating an existing machine learning algorithm in real-world contexts.  \n",

    "_Topic 1_\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweaking an existing algorithm \n",
    "This project involves finding an existing algorithm and making a modification that might improve its recall, precision, scalability, memory usage or speed. Other tweaks may include changing the algorithm so it applies in a different context.  \n",
    "\n",
    "_Topic 2_\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying an existing algorithm in a novel context\n",
    "This project involves finding an existing algorithm and applying it in a novel way. This might involve applying genetic sequencing algorithms to the optimization of hardware resource sharing, or the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) to optimize the arrangement of class schedules.  This topic is very closely related to “Tweaking an existing algorithm” in that one usually needs to make changes to use an algorithm in a novel context. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Topic 3_\n",
    "\n",
    "Validating an existing algorithm in real-world contexts \n",
    "This project involves finding how practically useful and applicable an existing algorithm really is in the “real world.” This involves empirically validating the sensitivity, recall, precision, scalability, memory usage and speed claims of an algorithm with realistic, noisy and non-ideal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Topic 4_\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a novel algorithm \n",
    "This project involves creating a novel algorithm that can answer an interesting real-world question. This topic is very closely related to “Tweaking an existing algorithm” in that one usually extends and improves what exists rather than create totally from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Topic versus Thesis_\n",
    "\n",
    "A topic is a general interest. A thesis statement presents an assertion; what you intend to do and how you intend to prove/convince others what you did is correct.  A topic of interest might be “What keywords should I add to my tweet to make it more viral?” \n",
    "\n",
    "A thesis is more specific and is framed such that the assertion is testable.  A thesis would be “We believe adding keywords according to our algorithm will significantly improve a tweets virality.”  The paper would then involve quantitatively defining virality and comparing the random tweets and the tweaked tweets with the keyword algorithm using reasonable real-world data (e.g. Twitter).\n",

    "You will submit your assignments via BlackBoard.\n",

    "•\tAt what price should I start an Ebay auction?\n",
    "•\tDo I want to follow that person back?\n",
    "•\tWhere should I place transmission towers?\n",

    "•\tMatching (Who is like/unlike me? What is the best TV, college, etc. for me?)\n",
    "•\tWhat is the reach of my tweet/post?\n",
    "•\tWhat are people saying about me on Twitter/ Facebook/ LinkedIn/ Google+:/ GitHub/ Web?\n",
    "•\tShould I add a picture/url to my tweet/post?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are an infinite number of interesting topics to which machine learning algorithms could be applied.  You want to keep your topic simple and doable. A topic like “Which genes cause cancer?” is of great interest but too broad for a topic. Analyzing existing gene expression quantification algorithms is more suitable for a project. The purpose of these projects is for students do get their “hands dirty,” not to necessarily develop break-through algorithms.  We will discuss how to do this research early in the semester.\n"
